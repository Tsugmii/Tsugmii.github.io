### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

Lab 1 introduced me to GitHub and Codespaces. These were central to the CPSC 120 course which was not the first time I coded, but it was the most in-depth I had ever gone. In this lab, I learned how to navigate Github and VS Code.

* Lab 3

Lab 3 showed me that I could make interactive programs. I could use a program I wrote to help people choose where to get their pizza. This code is special to me because it showed me I could use something I made to help others.

* Lab 7 Part 2

Lab 7 part 2 is one of my favorites because I felt the most accomplished when I completed it. Lab 7 part 2 had multiple files to work with which added to the difficulty. I learned to use all of my resources and that as long as I was dedicated enough I could finish it.
